# Predictive-Maintanence

## Description

This project is a web-based application designed for predictive maintenance in industrial settings. It leverages advanced machine learning models to predict equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and extending equipment lifespan.


## Interactive 
- Web Interface: Built with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for navigation across various insightful pages.
- Real-time Predictions: Allows users to input process parameters and receive predictions on potential equipment failures.
- Data Visualization: Users can visualize the data and analyze the behavior of the equipment through interactive charts and graphs.
- Performance Metrics: Includes a comparison of different machine learning models based on precision, recall, and F1 score.
